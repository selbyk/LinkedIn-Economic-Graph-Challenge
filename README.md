1. Main idea and how it's related to the Economic Graph initiative
2. Expected impact
3. High level approach

I want to help build LinkedIn's vision of economic opportunity for every member of the global
workforce by applying social reward techniques shown to double observed network activity in a
way that may stimulate network growth with an increase in sustained network activity. I think
it’s possible to improve on LinkedIn’s method of finding new users by integrating a social
rewards system designed to keep invited users engaged long enough to become a member of the
LinkedIn community and believe the users participating in the social rewards system will
generate a more sustained increase in network activity than users invited who do not participate
in the social rewards system.  Participates must be selected using the weight of their known
binary relationship with those they invite, and only the persons with a relational weight above
a to-be-determined constant should be offered entry into the program. If both of the participants
accept the terms of the program, they will receive rewards based on the activity of their partner,
incentivizing familiar communication urging the other to be involved in the LinkedIn community.

My idea stems from [Sandy Pentland](http://web.media.mit.edu/~sandy/)’s lecture on [Social Physics: How Good Ideas Spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMBl0ttu-Ow), one of the many great [Talks at Google](http://www.google.com/talks/). I do not have the time or resources to do this alone, but if the right team comes together, we might be able to make it happen.
